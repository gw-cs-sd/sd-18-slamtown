### Dependencies:
1. SPI Enable
2. I2C enable


### Tested platform:
1. Raspberry PI model B.
2. OS Raspbian.


### Build:
Step 1. In order to build this example, you'll have to first build the Lepton SDK binary.
Thsi will allow you to issue commands to the lepton over I2C, such as performing flat-field calibration. 
To do this:
> cd into ./IR_raspberry_server/LeptonSDKEmb32PUB
> run the command make

Step 2. In order to build the Lepton IR video streamer, do the follwoing:
> cd into the IR_raspberry_server
> runt the command make all


### Run:
Step 1. To run the video streamer server, please make sure that all the wires are properly connected: 
	Lepton's GND pin should be connected to RasPi's ground.
	Lepton's CS pin should be connected to RasPi's CE1 pin.
	Lepton's MISO pin should be connected to RasPI's MISO pin.
	Lepton's CLK pin should be connected to RasPI's SCLK pin.
	Lepton's VIN pin should be connected to RasPI's 3v3 pin.
	Lepton's SDA pin should be connected to RasPI's SDA pin.
	Lepton's SCL pin should be connected to RasPI's SCL pin.

Step 2. Now, follow these steps:
> cd into ./IR_raspberry_server/Build
> run the command ./LeptonServer
