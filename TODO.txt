Currently, the server will send a test picture in the directory to the client and the client will save it as the date and time it was received. 

Functionality changes to make:

-Currently, the connection will close when the image is sent. Instead, the server should wait until the next IMG_REQ.

-The client should connect to the local.pi hostname if possible.
